# Solar-Fan-Thermostat
Personal Project to build a thermostat using the ATMega (programmed using the Arduino Uno) to regulate temperature in a greenhouse using a Solar Powered Fan, using parts found in my universities ECE parts shop. ATMeg will just read a temperature and humidity from a sensor, display them to an LCD using I2C, and turn the fan on if temp goes to high using a transistor connecting the solar panel to the fan.

Programs are all written using the Arduino IDE. Might rewrite them in C given enough time to learn to translate between the two
