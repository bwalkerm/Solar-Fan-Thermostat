# Solar-Fan-Thermostat
Personal Project to build a thermostat using the ATMega (programmed using the Arduino Uno) to regulate temperature in a greenhouse using a Solar Powered Fan, using parts found in my universities ECE parts shop. ATMeg will just read a temperature and humidity from a sensor, display them to an LCD using I2C, and turn the fan on if temp goes to high using a transistor connecting the solar panel to the fan.

Programs are all written using the Arduino IDE. ̶ ̶M̶i̶g̶h̶t̶ ̶r̶e̶w̶r̶i̶t̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶m̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶C̶ ̶g̶i̶v̶e̶n̶ ̶e̶n̶o̶u̶g̶h̶ ̶t̶i̶m̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶l̶e̶a̶r̶n̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶t̶r̶a̶n̶s̶l̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶b̶e̶t̶w̶e̶e̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶t̶w̶o̶  coding an STM32 in C made me realize this project would take 10x as long, so its staying in the Arduino langauge.
